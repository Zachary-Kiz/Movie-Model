# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

This project attempts to model a video rental store. Multiple users can enter their preferences for a movie (genre, release decade, etc.) 
and the model will recommend a movie that fits each user's preference, if possible.
To use, run 'docker build -t cisc204', then open the folder in docker and execute run.py
